# DataDrivenModelling
The data-sets were too large to upload to GitHub


Running the code is done from the run.py file.

Changing the setup of the neural network is done in the config.sjon file

The way the code functions, and the theory behind how to use it can be found in my Thesis 

A quick guide on how to use the LSTM-code is:
1. Put your dataset in the data-folder
2. Use the norm
