This is the code for the pure Deep FeedForward Neural Network

To use the code, call the main function with all the neccessary inputs.

To change optimizer-function, change the two lines

criterion = torch.nn.MSELoss(reduction='sum')
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=lr)

in the def train function
